                               																	Why Hackers And Penterster Need TCP Client.

TCP Client:

There have been countless times during penetration tests that I’ve needed to whip up a TCP client to
test for services, send garbage data, fuzz, or any number of other tasks. If you are working within the
confines of large enterprise environments, you won’t have the luxury of networking tools or
compilers, and sometimes you’ll even be missing the absolute basics like the ability to copy/paste or
an Internet connection. This is where being able to quickly create a TCP client comes in extremely
handy.
